# Chess-In-Java
A Chess Game built in Java with AI and Pass-and-Play modes, a built-in timer, and move validation. It enforces chess rules, including check, checkmate, and stalemate detection. The AI uses the minimax algorithm for decision-making. Designed with OOP principles, the project focuses on game logic, event-driven programming, and state management.
